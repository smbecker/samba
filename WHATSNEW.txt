                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.13.8
                           April 29, 2021
                   ==============================


This is a security release in order to address the following defect:

o CVE-2021-20254: Negative idmap cache entries can cause incorrect group entries
  in the Samba file server process token.


=======
Details
=======

o  CVE-2021-20254:
   The Samba smbd file server must map Windows group identities (SIDs) into unix
   group ids (gids). The code that performs this had a flaw that could allow it
   to read data beyond the end of the array in the case where a negative cache
   entry had been added to the mapping cache. This could cause the calling code
   to return those values into the process token that stores the group
   membership for a user.

   Most commonly this flaw caused the calling code to crash, but an alert user
   (Peter Eriksson, IT Department, Link√∂ping University) found this flaw by
   noticing an unprivileged user was able to delete a file within a network
   share that they should have been disallowed access to.

   Analysis of the code paths has not allowed us to discover a way for a
   remote user to be able to trigger this flaw reproducibly or on demand,
   but this CVE has been issued out of an abundance of caution.


Changes since 4.13.7
--------------------

o  Volker Lendecke <vl@samba.org>
   * BUG 14571: CVE-2021-20254: Fix buffer overrun in sids_to_unixids().

=======
Details
=======

                   Release Notes for Samba 4.13.2
                          November 03, 2020
                   ==============================


This is the latest stable release of the Samba 4.13 release series.

Major enhancements include:
  o BUG 14537: ctdb-common: Avoid aliasing errors during code optimization.
  o BUG 14486: vfs_glusterfs: Avoid data corruption with the write-behind
               translator.


=======
Details
=======

The GlusterFS write-behind performance translator, when used with Samba, could
be a source of data corruption. The translator, while processing a write call,
immediately returns success but continues writing the data to the server in the
background. This can cause data corruption when two clients relying on Samba to
provide data consistency are operating on the same file.

The write-behind translator is enabled by default on GlusterFS.
The vfs_glusterfs plugin will check for the presence of the translator and
refuse to connect if detected. Please disable the write-behind translator for
the GlusterFS volume to allow the plugin to connect to the volume.


Changes since 4.13.1
--------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------


                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.13.1
                          October 29, 2020
                   ==============================


This is a security release in order to address the following defects:

o CVE-2020-14318: Missing handle permissions check in SMB1/2/3 ChangeNotify.
o CVE-2020-14323: Unprivileged user can crash winbind.
o CVE-2020-14383: An authenticated user can crash the DCE/RPC DNS with easily
		  crafted records.


=======
Details
=======

o  CVE-2020-14318:
   The SMB1/2/3 protocols have a concept of "ChangeNotify", where a client can
   request file name notification on a directory handle when a condition such as
   "new file creation" or "file size change" or "file timestamp update" occurs.

   A missing permissions check on a directory handle requesting ChangeNotify
   meant that a client with a directory handle open only for
   FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES (minimal access rights) could be used to obtain change
   notify replies from the server. These replies contain information that should
   not be available to directory handles open for FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTE only.

o  CVE-2020-14323:
   winbind in version 3.6 and later implements a request to translate multiple
   Windows SIDs into names in one request. This was done for performance
   reasons: The Microsoft RPC call domain controllers offer to do this
   translation, so it was an obvious extension to also offer this batch
   operation on the winbind unix domain stream socket that is available to local
   processes on the Samba server.

   Due to improper input validation a hand-crafted packet can make winbind
   perform a NULL pointer dereference and thus crash.

o  CVE-2020-14383:
   Some DNS records (such as MX and NS records) usually contain data in the
   additional section. Samba's dnsserver RPC pipe (which is an administrative
   interface not used in the DNS server itself) made an error in handling the
   case where there are no records present: instead of noticing the lack of
   records, it dereferenced uninitialised memory, causing the RPC server to
   crash. This RPC server, which also serves protocols other than dnsserver,
   will be restarted after a short delay, but it is easy for an authenticated
   non-admin attacker to crash it again as soon as it returns. The Samba DNS
   server itself will continue to operate, but many RPC services will not.

For more details, please refer to the security advisories.


Changes since 4.13.0
--------------------

o  Jeremy Allison <jra@samba.org>
   * BUG 14434: CVE-2020-14318: s3: smbd: Ensure change notifies can't get set
     unless the directory handle is open for SEC_DIR_LIST.

o  Douglas Bagnall <douglas.bagnall@catalyst.net.nz>
   * BUG 12795: CVE-2020-14383: Remote crash after adding NS or MX records using
     'samba-tool'.
   * BUG 14472: CVE-2020-14383: Remote crash after adding MX records.

o  Volker Lendecke <vl@samba.org>
   * BUG 14436: CVE-2020-14323: winbind: Fix invalid lookupsids DoS.

                   ==============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.13.0
                          September 22, 2020
                   ==============================


This is the first stable release of the Samba 4.13 release series.
Please read the release notes carefully before upgrading.


ZeroLogon
=========

Please avoid to set "server schannel = no" and "server schannel= auto" on all
Samba domain controllers due to the wellknown ZeroLogon issue.

For details please see
https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2020-1472.html.


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================
- bind DLZ: Added the ability to set allow/deny lists for zone
  transfer clients.
  Up to now, any client could use a DNS zone transfer request
  to the bind server, and get an answer from Samba.
  Now the default behaviour will be to deny those request.
  Two new options have been added to manage the list of
  authorized/denied clients for zone transfer requests.
  In order to be accepted, the request must be issued by a client
  that is in the allow list and NOT in the deny list.

Python 3.6 or later required
----------------------------

Samba's minimum runtime requirement for python was raised to Python
3.5 with samba 4.12.  Samba 4.13 raises this minimum version to Python
3.6 both to access new features and because this is the oldest version
we test with in our CI infrastructure.

This is also the last release where it will be possible to build Samba
(just the file server) with Python versions 2.6 and 2.7.

As Python 2.7 has been End Of Life upstream since April 2020, Samba
is dropping ALL Python 2.x support in the NEXT release.

Samba 4.14 to be released in March 2021 will require Python 3.6 or
later to build.

wide links functionality
------------------------

For this release, the code implementing the insecure "wide links = yes"
functionality has been moved out of the core smbd code and into a separate
VFS module, vfs_widelinks. Currently this vfs module is implicitly loaded
by smbd as the last but one module before vfs_default if "wide links = yes"
is enabled on the share (note, the existing restrictions on enabling wide
links around the SMB1 "unix extensions" and the "allow insecure wide links"
parameters are still in force). The implicit loading was done to allow
existing users of "wide links = yes" to keep this functionality without
having to make a change to existing working smb.conf files.

Please note that the Samba developers recommend changing any Samba
installations that currently use "wide links = yes" to use bind mounts
as soon as possible, as "wide links = yes" is an inherently insecure
configuration which we would like to remove from Samba. Moving the
feature into a VFS module allows this to be done in a cleaner way
in future.

A future release to be determined will remove this implicit linkage,
causing administrators who need this functionality to have to explicitly
add the vfs_widelinks module into the "vfs objects =" parameter lists.
The release notes will be updated to note this change when it occurs.

NT4-like 'classic' Samba domain controllers
-------------------------------------------

Samba 4.13 deprecates Samba's original domain controller mode.

Sites using Samba as a Domain Controller should upgrade from the
NT4-like 'classic' Domain Controller to a Samba Active Directory DC
to ensure full operation with modern windows clients.

SMBv1 only protocol options deprecated
--------------------------------------

A number of smb.conf parameters for less-secure authentication methods
which are only possible over SMBv1 are deprecated in this release.


VFS
---

The effort to modernize Samba's VFS interface has reached a major milestone with
the next release Samba 4.14.

For details please refer to the documentation at source3/modules/The_New_VFS.txt or
visit the <https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/The_New_VFS>.

Printing
--------

Publishing printers in AD is more reliable and more printer features are
added to the published information in AD. Samba now also supports Windows
drivers for the ARM64 architecture.


Client Group Policy
-------------------
This release extends Samba to support Group Policy functionality for Winbind
clients. Active Directory Administrators can set policies that apply Sudoers
configuration, and cron jobs to run hourly, daily, weekly or monthly.

To enable the application of Group Policies on a client, set the global
smb.conf option 'apply group policies' to 'yes'. Policies are applied on an
interval of every 90 minutes, plus a random offset between 0 and 30 minutes.

Policies applied by Samba are 'non-tattooing', meaning that changes can be
reverted by executing the `samba-gpupdate --unapply` command. Policies can be
re-applied using the `samba-gpupdate --force` command.
To view what policies have been or will be applied to a system, use the
`samba-gpupdate --rsop` command.

Administration of Samba policy requires that a Samba ADMX template be uploaded
to the SYSVOL share. The samba-tool command `samba-tool gpo admxload` is
provided as a convenient method for adding this policy. Once uploaded, policies
can be modified in the Group Policy Management Editor under Computer
Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates. Alternatively, Samba policy
may be managed using the `samba-tool gpo manage` command. This tool does not
require the admx templates to be installed.


Python 3.6 or later required
----------------------------

Samba's minimum runtime requirement for python was raised to Python
3.6 with samba 4.13.  Samba 4.14 raises this minimum version to Python
3.6 also to build Samba. It is no longer possible to build Samba
(even just the file server) with Python versions 2.6 and 2.7.

As Python 2.7 has been End Of Life upstream since April 2020, Samba
is dropping ALL Python 2.x support in this release.


NT4-like 'classic' Samba domain controllers
-------------------------------------------

Samba 4.13 deprecates Samba's original domain controller mode.

Sites using Samba as a Domain Controller should upgrade from the
NT4-like 'classic' Domain Controller to a Samba Active Directory DC
to ensure full operation with modern windows clients.


SMBv1 only protocol options deprecated
--------------------------------------

A number of smb.conf parameters for less-secure authentication methods
which are only possible over SMBv1 are deprecated in this release.


Miscellaneous samba-tool changes
--------------------------------

The samba-tool commands to manage AD objects (e.g. users, computers and
groups) now consistently use the "add" command when adding a new object to
the AD. The previous deprecation warnings when using the "add" commands
have been removed. For compatibility reasons, both the "add" and "create"
commands can be used now.

Users, groups and contacts can now be renamed with the respective rename
commands.

Locked users can be unlocked with the new "samba-tool user unlock" command.

The "samba-tool user list" and "samba-tool group listmembers" commands
provide additional options to hide expired and disabled user accounts
(--hide-expired and --hide-disabled).


CTDB CHANGES
============

* The NAT gateway and LVS features now uses the term "leader" to refer
  to the main node in a group through which traffic is routed and
  "follower" for other members of a group.  The command for
  determining the leader has changed to "ctdb natgw leader" (from
  "ctdb natgw master").  The configuration keyword for indicating that
  a node can not be the leader of a group has changed to
  "follower-only" (from "slave-only").  Identical changes were made
  for LVS.

* Remove "ctdb isnotrecmaster" command.  It isn't used by CTDB's
  scripts and can be checked by users with "ctdb pnn" and "ctdb
  recmaster".

Scanning of trusted domains and enterprise principals
-----------------------------------------------------

As an artifact from the NT4 times, we still scanned the list of trusted domains
on winbindd startup. This is wrong as we never can get a full picture in Active
Directory. It is time to change the default value to "No". Also with this change
we always use enterprise principals for Kerberos so that the DC will be able
to redirect ticket requests to the right DC. This is e.g. needed for one way
trusts. The options `winbind use krb5 enterprise principals` and
`winbind scan trusted domains` will be deprecated in one of the next releases.
